\title{Prepare intervention timing for odin}
\usage{
intervention_dates_for_odin(dates, start_date, steps_per_day)
}
\arguments{
\item{dates}{Dates (or ISO-formatted strings for
conversion with \code{\link{as.Date}} at which R0 changes.}

\item{start_date}{The date to start the simulation from.  Must be
earlier than the first date in \code{data}.}

\item{steps_per_day}{The number of steps per day}
}
\description{
Prepare dates of intervention for use with odin.  This function
exists to make explicit how time changes through the model
relative to the data and to odin's internal clock.
