squire enables users to simulate models of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. This is done using an age-structured SEIR model that also explicitly considers healthcare capacity and disease severity. 

## Overview

squire is a package enabling users to quickly and easily generate calibrated estimates of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories under different control scenarios. It consists of the following:

* An age-structured SEIR model incorporating explicit passage through healthcare settings and explicit progression through disease severity stages.
* The ability to calibrate the model to different epidemic start-dates based on available death data.
* Simulate the impacts of different control interventions (including general social distancing, specific shielding of elderly populations, and more stringent suppression strategies).

If you are new to squire, the best place to start is below, where we detail how to install the package, how to set up the model, and how to run it with and without control interventions. 

## Model Structure

### Overall Structure

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrc-ide/squire/master/images/Explicit_Healthcare_Model_Structure.JPG" align="center" style = "border: none; float: center;" width = "600px">

squire uses an age-structured SEIR model, with the infectious class divided into different stages reflecting progression through different disese severity pathways. These compartments are:  
* S = Susceptibles  
* E = Exposed (Latent Infection)  
* I<sub>Mild</sub> = Mild Infections (Not Requiring Hospitalisation)  
* I<sub>Case</sub> = Infections Requiring Hospitalisation  
* I<sub>Hospital</sub> = Hospitalised (Requires Hospital Bed)  
* I<sub>ICU</sub> = ICU (Requires ICU Bed)  
* I<sub>Rec</sub> = Recovering from ICU Stay (Requires Hospital Bed)  
* R = Recovered  
* D = Dead  

### Decision Trees for Healthcare Capacity 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrc-ide/squire/master/images/Explicit_Healthcare_Oxygen_Decision_Tree.JPG" align="center" style = "border: none; float: center;" width = "400px">

Given initial inputs of hospital/ICU bed capacity and the average time cases spend in hospital, the model dynamically tracks available hospital and ICU beds over time. 

Individuals newly requiring hospitalisation (either a hospital or ICU bed) are then assigned to either receive care (if the relevant bed is available) or not (if maximum capacity would be exceeded otherwise). Whether or not an individual receives the required care modifies their probability of dying.  


## Installation

<i>squire</i> utilises the package [ODIN](https://github.com/mrc-ide/odin) to generate the model. [ODIN](https://github.com/mrc-ide/odin) implements a high-level language for implementing mathematical models and can be installed by running the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("odin")
```

The model generated using ODIN is written in C and so you will require a compiler to install dependencies for the package and to build any models with ODIN. Windows users should install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).  See the relevant section in [R-admin](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#The-Windows-toolset) for advice.  Be sure to select the "edit PATH" checkbox during installation or the tools will not be found.

The function `odin::can_compile()` will check if it is able to compile things, but by the time you install the package that will probably have been satisfied.

After installation of ODIN, ensure you have the devtools package installed by running the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then install the <i>squire</i> package directly from GitHub by running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/squire")
```

If you have any problems installing then please raise an issue on the <i>squire</i> [`GitHub`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/squire/issues). 

If everything has installed correctly, we then need to load the package: 

```{r}
library(squire)
```

## Getting Started

### Running the Model (Unmitigated)

### 1. Running the model using baseline parameters and no control interventions  

The full model is referred to as the **explicit_SEEIR** model, with hospital
pathways explicltly exploring whether individuals will require a general 
hospital bed providing oxygen or an ICU bed that provides ventilation. 

To run the model we need to provide at least one of the following arguments:

* `country`
* `population` and `contact_matrix_set`

If the `country` is provided, the `population` and `contact_matrix_set` 
will be generated (if not also specified) using the demographics and matrices
specified in the [global report](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-12-global-impact-covid-19/).

To run the model by providing the `country` we use `run_explicit_SEEIR_model()`:

```{r basic model run country}
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(country = "Afghanistan")
```

The returned object is a `squire_simulation` object, which is a list of two 
ojects: 

* `output` - model output
* `parameters` - model parameters

`squire_simulation` objects can be plotted as follows:

```{r base plot}
plot(r)
```

This plot will plot each of the compartments of the model output. We can also plot specific compartments using the `var_select` argument that can be passed to `plot()`. Arguments passed to `var_select` must be one of the variables in the plot above.

```{r subset variables plot}
plot(r, var_select = c("E", "IMild"))
```
Or, you can specify one of `deaths`, `infections`, `hospital_occupancy`, `ICU_occupancy`, `hospital_demand` or `ICU_demand`, and plot these summary metrics that represent the combintion of a number of different compartment e.g:
```{r subset variables plot2}
plot(r, var_select = "deaths")
```

All of the plotting above makes uses of the `squire` function `format_output` which provides you with a means of manipulating and managing the output from a `run_explicit_SEEIR_model` call. Using it you can specify the model outputs (e.g. compartments) you want, as well as whether you want that output aggregated over age or not. Here we extract the latent compartment (E). The data columns correspond to the compartment name (`compartment`), timestep (`t`), model run number (`replicate`) and the model output (`y`). 

``` {r format output}

output <- format_output(r, var_select = "E")
head(output)

```

If we wanted age-disaggregated data, we could set `reduce_age` to `FALSE` which will generate the same dataframe as before, but with an additional column indicating the age-group. 

``` {r format output age disagg}

output <- format_output(r, var_select = "E", reduce_age = FALSE)
head(output)

```

### 2. Changing parameters in the model. 

The model has a number of parameters for setting the R0, demography, contact 
matrices, the durations of each compartment and the health care outcomes and
healthcare availability. In addition, the initial state of the population can
be changed as well as simulation parameters, such as the number of replicates, 
length of simulation and the timestep. For a full list of model inputs, please
see the function [documentation](https://mrc-ide.github.io/squire/reference/run_explicit_SEEIR_model.html)

For example, changing the initial R0 (default = 3), number of replicates (
default = 10), simualtion length (default = 365 days) and time step (default = 
0.5 days), as well as setting the population and contact matrix manually:

```{r set params}

# Get the population
pop <- get_population("United Kingdom")
population <- pop$n

# Get the mixing matrix
contact_matrix <- get_mixing_matrix("United Kingdom")

# run the model
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, 
                              contact_matrix_set = contact_matrix,
                              R0 = 2.5, 
                              time_period = 200,
                              dt = 0.1,
                              replicates = 5)
plot(r)
```

We can also change the R0 and contact matrix at set time points, to reflect 
changing behaviour resulting from interventions. For example to set a 80%
reduction in the contact matrix after 100 days :

```{r set contact matrix decrease}

# run the model
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, 
                              tt_contact_matrix = c(0, 100),
                              contact_matrix_set = list(contact_matrix,
                                                        contact_matrix*0.2),
                              R0 = 2.5, 
                              time_period = 200,
                              dt = 0.1,
                              replicates = 5)
plot(r, var_select = "infections")
```
where `n_E2_I` is the daily number of new infections.

To show an 80% reduction after 50 days but only maintained for 30 days :

```{r set contact matrix decrease and relax}

# run the model
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, 
                              tt_contact_matrix = c(0, 80, 120),
                              contact_matrix_set = list(contact_matrix,
                                                        contact_matrix*0.2,
                                                        contact_matrix),
                              R0 = 2.5, 
                              time_period = 220,
                              dt = 0.1,
                              replicates = 5)
plot(r, var_select = "infections")
```

Alternatively, we could set a changing R0, which falls below 1 after 50 days:

```{r set R0 decrease}

# run the model
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, 
                              contact_matrix_set = contact_matrix,
                              tt_R0 = c(0, 80),
                              R0 = c(2.5, 0.9),
                              time_period = 200,
                              dt = 0.1,
                              replicates = 5)
plot(r, var_select = "infections")
```

The model in squire also allows you to alter healthcare capacity. Default values for the arguments `hosp_bed_capacity` and `ICU_capacity` are taken from the World Bank and a systematic review of the literature. However, you can also specify your own:

``` {r change healthcare capacity}

library(patchwork)

r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, 
                              contact_matrix_set = contact_matrix,
                              R0 = 2.5, 
                              time_period = 200,
                              dt = 0.1,
                              replicates = 15,
                              hosp_bed_capacity = 1000,
                              ICU_bed_capacity = 100)

c <- plot(r, var_select = "hospital_occupancy")
d <- plot(r, var_select = "ICU_occupancy")
c / d 


```

### 3. Extracting and Plotting Relevant Outputs  

Whilst the above provides quick and easy ways to plot relevant outputs, we recognise users might want to play around with the data themselves. This can be done with the `format_output` function. 


```{r untransformed}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(dplyr)

x <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(country = "Afghanistan", hosp_bed_capacity = 500, ICU_bed_capacity = 1000)

deaths <- format_output(x = x, var_select = "deaths") %>%
  mutate(replicate = factor(replicate))
a <- ggplot(deaths, aes(x = t, y = y, col = replicate)) +
  geom_line() + ylab("Daily Deaths")

infections <- format_output(x = x, var_select = "infections") %>%
  mutate(replicate = factor(replicate))
b <- ggplot(infections, aes(x = t, y = y, col = replicate)) +
  geom_line() + ylab("Daily Infections")

hosp_bed <- format_output(x = x, var_select = "hospital_occupancy") %>%
  mutate(replicate = factor(replicate))
c <- ggplot(hosp_bed, aes(x = t, y = y, col = replicate)) +
  geom_line() + ylab("Hospital Bed Occupancy")

ICU_bed <- format_output(x = x, var_select = "ICU_occupancy") %>%
  mutate(replicate = factor(replicate))
d <- ggplot(ICU_bed, aes(x = t, y = y, col = replicate)) +
  geom_line() + ylab("ICU Bed Occupancy")

z <- a + b + c + d +
  plot_layout(guides = 'collect')
z

```

### 4.  Calibrating the Model to Observed Deaths Data

The model can be simply calibrated to the cumulative time series of deaths reported in settings. This can be done using the `calibrate` function. For example, let's generate some dummy time series data and calibrate to it:

```{r example data}
df <- squire:::death_data_format(reporting_quality = 1)
df
```

Then to calibrate to this dummy data and visualise the full epidemic curve, we do the following. Note that simulation replicates are aligned to the current death total and the outputs are returned as a `squire_simulation` object. 

```{r calibration}
calibration <- calibrate(country = "Afghanistan", deaths = max(df$deaths), 
                         reporting_fraction = 1,
                         seeding_age_groups = c("35-40", "40-45", "45-50", "50-55"),
                         min_seeding_cases = 5, max_seeding_cases = 50,
                         replicates = 10, dt = 0.25)

plot(calibration, var_select = "infections", date_0 = Sys.Date())

```

In the above, we visualise the full epidemic curve, but to examine short term model estimates of the epidemic trajectory (e.g. up to 14 days ahead), we can do the following: 

```{r deaths over time}

x <- format_output(calibration, var_select = "infections", date_0 = Sys.Date())
x <- x %>%
  mutate(replicate = factor(replicate)) %>%
  filter(t < 14)
ggplot(x, aes(x = date, y = y, col = replicate)) +
  geom_line() + ylab("Case Incidence") + xlab("Date") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```

### 5. Conducting scenario projections to fitted data

Once you have calibrated the model to death data, it is possible to then implement mitigation strategies forwards in time from the point of calibration. This is achieved using the `projection` function. For example, to contrast an unmitigated epidemic against a mitigation scenario with a 20% reduction in R0 today and a further 40% in 20 days time:

```{r projection}

# first calibrate
t1 <- calibrate(country = "Angola", 
                deaths = 5,
                  reporting_fraction = 1,
                  dt = 0.2,
                  time_period = 200,
                  replicates = 25,
                  R0_scan = c(3,4,5))

# create our projections
p2 <- projections(r = t1, R0_change = c(0.3, 0.15), tt_R0 = c(0, 20))
```

The output generated from `projections` is the same class and structure as from `calibrate` and can be plotted against the unmitigated scenario using `projection_plotting`:

```{r projection plotting}
ggproj <- projection_plotting(r_list = list(t1,p2),
                    scenarios = c("Unmitigated","Mitigation"),
                    var_select = c("ICU_occupancy", "ICU_demand"),
                    add_parms_to_scenarios = TRUE,ci = FALSE,summarise = TRUE)

# and lets add in the ICU capacity
ggproj + ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = t1$parameters$ICU_bed_capacity)
```

We can see above that the intervention introduced was insufficient to prevent ICU demand (in red) from exceeding the supply, whereas in the unmitigated strategy this did occur.

We can also model changing interventions by changing the contact matrix over time as well as the availability of ICU and hospital beds. E.g. decreasing contacts by 50% today before relaxing it to 80% in 20 days time, while increasing hospital and ICU beds by 20% in 30 days time. (N.B. We can turn off the automatic scenario parameter labelling with `add_parms_to_scenarios = FALSE`):

```{r projection relative beds}

# first calibrate
t1 <- calibrate(country = "Angola", 
                deaths = 5,
                  reporting_fraction = 1,
                  dt = 0.2,
                  time_period = 200,
                  replicates = 25,
                  R0_scan = c(3,4,5))

# create our projections
p2 <- projections(r = t1, 
                  contact_matrix_set_change = c(0.5, 0.8), 
                  tt_contact_matrix = c(0, 20), 
                  hosp_bed_capacity_change = c(1, 1.2),
                  tt_hosp_beds = c(0, 30),
                  ICU_bed_capacity_change = c(1, 1.2),
                  tt_ICU_beds = c(0,30))

projection_plotting(r_list = list(t1,p2),
                    scenarios = c("Unmitigated","Mitigation"),
                    var_select = c("ICU_occupancy", "ICU_demand","deaths"),
                    add_parms_to_scenarios = FALSE,
                    ci = FALSE,summarise = TRUE)
```

Above we can see that the increase in bed causes the mitigation strategy to plateau at a higher bed occupancy, however, not high enough to meet the demand. However, despite this the the peak in daily deaths is lower, which in turn causes a noticable decrease in total deaths:

```{r total deaths projection}
projection_plotting(r_list = list(t1,p2),
                    scenarios = c("Unmitigated","Mitigation"),
                    var_select = c("D"),
                    add_parms_to_scenarios = FALSE,
                    ci = FALSE,summarise = TRUE)
```

Lastly, rather than using relative changes to the interventions, we can provide absolute measures. For example, to change the R0 to 2 today and add 5000 ICU beds in 40 days time: 

```{r projection plotting absolute}

# what is the current capacity
icu <- tail(t1$parameters$ICU_bed_capacity,1)

# create our projections
p2 <- projections(r = t1, 
                  R0 = 2,
                  tt_R0 = 0,
                  ICU_bed_capacity = c(icu, icu + 5000),
                  tt_ICU_beds = c(0,40))

projection_plotting(r_list = list(t1,p2),
                    scenarios = c("Unmitigated","Mitigation"),
                    var_select = c("ICU_occupancy", "ICU_demand","deaths"),
                    add_parms_to_scenarios = FALSE,
                    ci = FALSE,summarise = TRUE)
```
