squire enables users to simulate models of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. This is done using an age-structured SEIR model that also explicitly considers healthcare capacity and disease severity. 

## Overview

squire is a package enabling users to quickly and easily generate calibrated estimates of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories under different control scenarios. It consists of the following:

* An age-structured SEIR model incorporating explicit passage through healthcare settings and explicit progression through disease severity stages.
* The ability to calibrate the model to different epidemic start-dates based on available death data.
* Simulate the impacts of different control interventions (including general social distancing, specific shielding of elderly populations, and more stringent suppression strategies).

If you are new to squire, the best place to start is below, where we detail how to install the package, how to set up the model, and how to run it with and without control interventions. 

## Model Structure

### Overall Structure

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrc-ide/squire/healthcare_capacity/images/Explicit_Healthcare_Model_Structure.JPG" align="center" style = "border: none; float: center;" width = "600px">

squire uses an age-structured SEIR model, with the infectious class divided into different stages reflecting progression through different disese severity pathways. These compartments are:  
* S = Susceptibles  
* E = Exposed (Latent Infection)  
* I<sub>Mild</sub> = Mild Infections (Not Requiring Hospitalisation)  
* I<sub>Case</sub> = Infections Requiring Hospitalisation  
* I<sub>Hospital</sub> = Hospitalised (Requires Hospital Bed)  
* I<sub>ICU</sub> = ICU (Requires ICU Bed)  
* I<sub>Rec</sub> = Recovering from ICU Stay (Requires Hospital Bed)  
* R = Recovered  
* D = Dead  

### Decision Trees for Healthcare Capacity 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrc-ide/squire/healthcare_capacity/images/Explicit_Healthcare_Oxygen_Decision_Tree.JPG" align="center" style = "border: none; float: center;" width = "400px">

Given initial inputs of hospital/ICU bed capacity and the average time cases spend in hospital, the model dynamically tracks available hospital and ICU beds over time. 

Individuals newly requiring hospitalisation (either a hospital or ICU bed) are then assigned to either receive care (if the relevant bed is available) or not (if maximum capacity would be exceeded otherwise). Whether or not an individual receives the required care modifies their probability of dying.  


## Installation

<i>squire</i> utilises the package [ODIN](https://github.com/mrc-ide/odin) to generate the model. [ODIN](https://github.com/mrc-ide/odin) implements a high-level language for implementing mathematical models and can be installed by running the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("odin")
```

The model generated using ODIN is written in C and so you will require a compiler to install dependencies for the package and to build any models with ODIN. Windows users should install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).  See the relevant section in [R-admin](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#The-Windows-toolset) for advice.  Be sure to select the "edit PATH" checkbox during installation or the tools will not be found.

The function `odin::can_compile()` will check if it is able to compile things, but by the time you install the package that will probably have been satisfied.

After installation of ODIN, ensure you have the devtools package installed by running the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then install the <i>squire</i> package directly from GitHub by running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/squire")
```

If you have any problems installing then please raise an issue on the <i>squire</i> [`GitHub`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/squire/issues). 

If everything has installed correctly, we then need to load the package: 

```{r}
library(squire)
```

## Getting Started

### Running the Model (Unmitigated)

### 1. Running the model using baseline parameters and no control interventions  

The full model is referred to as the **explicit_SEEIR** model, with hospital
pathways explicltly exploring whether individuals will require a general 
hospital bed providing oxygen or an ICU bed that provides ventilation. 

To run the model we need to provide at least one of the following arguments:

* `country`
* `population` and `contact_matrix_set`

If the `country` is provided, the `population` and `contact_matrix_set` 
will be generated (if not also specified) using the demographics and matrices
specified in the [global report](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-12-global-impact-covid-19/).

To run the model by providing the `country` we use `run_explicit_SEEIR_model()`:

```{r basic model run country}
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(country = "Afghanistan")
```

The returned object is a `squire_simulation` object, which is a list of two 
ojects: 

* `output` - model output
* `parameters` - model parameters

`squire_simulation` objects can be plotted as follows:

```{r base plot}
plot(r)
```
This plot will plot each of the compartments of the model output. 

### 2. Changing parameters in the model. 

The model has a number of parameters for setting the R0, demography, contact 
matrices, the durations of each compartment and the health care outcomes and
healthcare availability. In addition, the initial state of the population can
be changed as well as simulation parameters, such as the number of replicates, 
length of simulation and the timestep. For a full list of model inputs, please
see the function [documentation](https://mrc-ide.github.io/squire/reference/run_explicit_SEEIR_model.html)

For example, changing the initial R0 (default = 3), number of replicates (
default = 10), simualtion length (default = 365 days) and time step (default = 
0.5 days), as well as setting the population and contact matrix manually:

```{r set params}

# Get the population
pop <- get_population("United Kingdom")
population <- pop$n

# Get the mixing matrix
contact_matrix <- get_mixing_matrix("United Kingdom")

# run the model
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, 
                              contact_matrix_set = contact_matrix,
                              R0 = 2.5, 
                              time_period = 200,
                              dt = 1,
                              replicates = 5)
plot(r)
```

We can also change the R0 and contact matrix at set time points, to reflect 
changing behaviour resulting from interventions. For example to set a 80%
reduction in the contact matrix after 50 days :

```{r set contact matrix decrease}

# run the model
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, 
                              tt_contact_matrix = c(0, 50),
                              contact_matrix_set = list(contact_matrix,
                                                        contact_matrix*0.2),
                              R0 = 2.5, 
                              time_period = 200,
                              dt = 1,
                              replicates = 5)
plot(r)
```

To show an 80% reduction after 50 days but only maintained for 30 days :

```{r set contact matrix decrease and relax}

# run the model
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, 
                              tt_contact_matrix = c(0, 50, 80),
                              contact_matrix_set = list(contact_matrix,
                                                        contact_matrix*0.2,
                                                        contact_matrix),
                              R0 = 2.5, 
                              time_period = 200,
                              dt = 1,
                              replicates = 5)
plot(r)
```

Alternatively, we could set a changing R0, which falls below 1 after 50 days:

```{r set R0 decrease}

# run the model
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, 
                              contact_matrix_set = contact_matrix,
                              tt_R0 = c(0, 50),
                              R0 = c(2.5, 0.9),
                              time_period = 200,
                              dt = 1,
                              replicates = 5)
plot(r)
```

### 3. Extracting and Plotting Relevant Outputs  

Alternative summaries of the models can be created, which give commonly reported
measures, such as deaths, number of ICU beds and general hospital beds required. 

These could be created by using the outputs seen in the previous section, e.g. 
`r$output$ICase1 + r$output$ICase2` to get the total symptomatic cases. 

However, accessing outputs this waus is much slower. A quicker way is to change the
simulation output with `output_transform = FALSE`, which will not transform the 
outputs produced by odin. 

```{r untransformed}
# run the model
r <- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(country = "Afghanistan",
                              output_transform = FALSE)

```

To access the outputs we can use `untransformed_output`, specifying  
which compartments are to be returned, and which specific summary outputs related
to case incidence, death incidence and hospital bed demands are needed:

```{r untransformed get}

gcu <- untransformed_output(r, compartments = c("S", "R"),
                               deaths = TRUE, 
                               cases = TRUE, 
                               beds = TRUE)
```

This object can then be easily plotted:

```{r plot gcu}
plot(gcu)
```

### 4.  Calibrating the Model to Observed Deaths Data

The model can be simply calibrated to time series of deaths reported in settings. 
This can be conducted using the `calibrate` function, by providing a data frame
of date and deaths. For example:

```{r example data}

# create dummy data
df <- data.frame("date" = Sys.Date() - 0:6,
                 "deaths" = c(6, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),
                 "cases" = c(394, 101, 89, 4, 0, 0, 0))
df
```

```{r calibrate run}
# run calibrate
out <- calibrate(data = df, country = "Senegal", replicates = 10)
```

Simulation replicates are aligned to the current death total and the outputs are 
returned as a `squire_calibration` object, which has dedicated plotting functions.

These allow the predicted cumulative cases based from the observed deaths to be plotted:

```{r cases over time}
plot(out, what = "cases")
```

Additionally, we can plot the incidence of deaths as well as the healthcare
demands:

```{r healthcare over time}
plot(out, what = "healthcare")
```

We can also control how far we forecast. To forecast for 14 days:

```{r healthcare forecast over time}
plot(out, what = "healthcare", forecast = 14)
```
